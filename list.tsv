You made the only mistake you had the opportunity to make."""	Epictectus
97	"""I mean, are these the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the Capitol? But to use one's impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a word, to fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees with your position and what conflicts , is nothing wrong in all of that?"""	Epictectus

100	"""Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too, ready to understand heaven and earth."""	Marcus Aurelius
101	"""It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own."""	Marcus Aurelius
102	"""However much you possess there's someone else who has more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to the exact extent to which you lag behind him."""	Seneca
103	Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those who are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach.	Seneca

118	"""If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed."""	Marcus Aurelius
119	"""Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking."""	Marcus Aurelius
120	"""The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane."""	Marcus Aurelius

127	"""When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you."""	Marcus Aurelius
128	"""Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look."""	Marcus Aurelius
129	"""Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness , all of them due to the offenders' ignorance of what is good or evil."""	Marcus Aurelius

174	"Sickness harms the body, not the will. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens."	Epictetus
175	"Upon every misfortune, turn toward yourself and ask which of your faculties may offer a solution. If pain, then strength; if insult, then patience. Existence will not overwhelm you."	Epictetus
176	"It is better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation."	Epictetus
177	There is a price paid for peace and tranquility; and nothing is to be had for nothing.	Epictetus
178	Be content to show foolishness and dullness on the exterior. Do not desire to be thought to know anything.	Epictetus
179	"If you wish your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so. Exercise only what is in your power."	Epictetus

194	"You will be everything, but nothing in earnest. You mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. You have never entered upon anything considerately, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Consider first what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. You must be one thing. You must cultivate your own reason and apply yourself to things within you."	Epictetus
195	"Begin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, one you may preserve both alone and in company."	Epictetus
196	"Be silent, or speak what is needful, and in few words. You may enter into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it. Let it not run into any of the common subjects, and especially not on other people, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons."	Epictetus
197	"Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant."	Epictetus
198	Avoid taking oaths as far as you are able.	Epictetus
199	"Avoid public and vulgar entertainment. If ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon your mind, that you may not slide into vulgarity."	Epictetus

201	"Be not uncharitable or severe to those who seem evil, nor boast that you yourself live otherwise."	Epictetus

203	"It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles. If ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, wish things to be only just as they are, for thus nothing will go against you. Abstain from derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed."	Epictetus
204	"Be not prompt or ready to attend private functions. If you must attend, preserve your dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable."	Epictetus
205	"When you are going before anyone in power, the doors may not be opened to you, and they may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens."	Epictetus
206	"In company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. Avoid attempts to excite laughter, for this may slide you into vulgarity and may lower you in the esteem of your acquaintances. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous."	Epictetus
207	"If you are enticed by promised pleasure, let the affair wait your leisure. Bring to your mind both points of time‚Äîthat in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that after you have enjoyed it."	Epictetus
208	"When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, do it, even though the world should misunderstand it. If you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself. If you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you."	Epictetus
209	"At a feast, to choose the largest share is suitable to the bodily appetite, but inconsistent with the social spirit. When you eat with another, value the bodies of those things which are set before you, and your courtesy toward your host."	Epictetus
